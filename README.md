# thispersondoesnotexist-scrapper
A script to scrape StyleGAN images generated for non-existent people, cats and art

The script scrapes images generated at the following URLs and stores them into separate folders. That is all.
- https://thispersondoesnotexist.com
- https://thisartworkdoesnotexist.com
- https://thiscatdoesnotexist.com  


What you do with those images is up to you.  
May be use them for something like [@wedontexisthere](https://twitter.com/wedontexisthere)?.  
You might want to check Nvidia's licensing policy around commercial usage as they developed these sites and the Neural Net behind them.
